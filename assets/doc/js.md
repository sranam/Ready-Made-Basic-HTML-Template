table of contents](TOC.md)

# The JavaScript

Information about the default JavaScript included in the project.

## main.js

This file can be used to contain or reference your JavaScript/jQuery plugin activation code.
If you're working on something more advanced you might replace this file
entirely. That's cool. 

## vendor

This directory can be used to contain all 3rd party library code.

Minified versions of the latest jQuery, html5shiv, respondjs and Modernizr libraries are included by
default. You may wish to create your own [custom Modernizr
build with the online builder](https://www.modernizr.com/download/) or [command
line tool](https://modernizr.com/docs#command-line-config).
