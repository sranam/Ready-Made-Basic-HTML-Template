# Ready Made Starter HTML Template

Ready Made starter HTML Template is a basic html front-end template. It helps developers to start their 

front-end development on the fly.

This template is based on and inspired by [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/). Thanks a 

bunch to HTML5 Boilerplate and the dedicated team.

## Features

* WordPress friendly code. So if you intend to use the template for WordPress theme development later 

on, then you would be a one step closer to it. Go through the HTML, CSS, and jS files and see for 

yourself.

* As far as possible, the front-end files are kept in a directory named assets. It is intended to keep 

the root directory neat and clear for back-end files.

* Themeforest standard coding. Developers can use it for their Themeforest project.
