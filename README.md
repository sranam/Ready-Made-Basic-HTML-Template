# Ready Made Starter HTML5 Template

Ready Made Starter HTML5 Template is a basic html5 front-end template. It helps developers to start their 
front-end web development on the fly.

It is also, most importantly, WordPress-friendly and Themeforest standard.

This template is tailored based on [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/). We give HTML5 Boilerplate team our heartfelt thanks for their awesome work.

## Features

* WordPress friendly code. So if you intend to use the template for WordPress theme development later 
on, then you would be a one step closer to it. Go through the HTML, CSS, and jS files and see for 
yourself.
* Themeforest standard coding. Developers can use it for their Themeforest project.
* As far as possible, the front-end files are kept in a directory named assets. It is intended that the root directory remains neat and clear for back-end files.
