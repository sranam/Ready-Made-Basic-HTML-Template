# Ready Made Starter HTML Template

Ready Made starter HTML Template is a basic html front-end template. It helps developers to start their 

front-end web development on the fly.

This template is tailored based on [HTML5 Boilerplate] (https://html5boilerplate.com/). We give HTML5 Boilerplate team our heartfelt thanks for their awesome work. 

thanks to HTML5 Boilerplate and its dedicated team.

## Features

* WordPress friendly code. So if you intend to use the template for WordPress theme development later 

on, then you would be a one step closer to it. Go through the HTML, CSS, and jS files and see for 

yourself.

* Themeforest standard coding. Developers can use it for their Themeforest project.

* As far as possible, the front-end files are kept in a directory named assets. It is intended that the 

root directory remains neat and clear for back-end files.
